// 7 primitive data types-> string,number,bigint,boolean,symbol(for uniqueness),null(it is an object),undefined.
// There is one more type which is called an object.
let mobileNumber = 123
let name = "Rahul"
let address//this is undefined
// typeof tells you the data type:
console.table([typeof name,typeof address,typeof mobileNumber,typeof null]);
// => null is not a type,it is an object.
console.table([typeof sdjfbjehfbqw,typeof string,typeof undefined])
// if any random word is written in front of typeof then it will o/p 'undefined'.Also,(typeof undefined) will also o/p undefined.
